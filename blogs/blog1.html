        <h1>Learning Front-End Development</h1>

        <section>
            <p>As a Computer Science student at Rutgers University in 2025, I have been 
                surrounded by the fear of impending doom of the job market that waits for 
                me in 2028. Juggling through many potential options to target for my career, 
                there seems to be a common trend where projects are incredibly helpful to build experience. 
                As I have seen, many "entry level" positions require a solid portfolio of work to even be 
                considered, let alone years of experience. </p>

            <p>I have tried to create projects throughout my freshman year of college and 
                even attempting to go through freeCodeCamp's front-end developer course just 
                to get the certificate. That is when I bumped into the issue that thought I 
                was very good at computer science and math, I was not so good at software 
                engineering. For the summer of 2025, as I remain internship-less and 
                unexperienced, I have decided to focus on building my skills through personal
                 projects and online courses. By taking the opportunity to go through the 
                 grueling and slow process of enforcing the fundamentals of full stack 
                 development, I will be able to show whatever project I choose to create 
                 contained in an attractive and operating website.</p>

            <p>Through out the summer, I will focus on front-end development, covering essential 
                  topics such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These technologies form the 
                  backbone of web development and are crucial for creating visually appealing
                   and interactive user interfaces. These will lay the foundations of web 
                   design and web development to later be fully operational when connected
                    to a backend. As I progress through this journey, I will document my 
                    journey through the resources and tips I have gained
                  on the way.</p>

                <h2>Note Before Reading This</h2>
                <p>This is the summer of 2025. AI is slowly being integrating into software
                    exngineering and web development. Though if you are in the same position
                    as I was, you may rather skip the fundamentals and go straight to
                    building projects by using AI tools. I have taken it upon myself to
                    learn the fundamentals of web development before I start using AI tools
                    to build projects. I believe that understanding the core concepts will
                    make me a better developer in the long run. Also as I have experienced
                    before, not understanding the fundamentals of web development will
                    lead to a lot of confusion and frustration when trying to build projects
                    in the long run.

                <h2>Getting Started with HTML</h2>
                <p>For this part of the journey and how I imagine I will continue on for both
                    learning CSS and JavaScript, I will be using the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer">freeCodeCamp full stack
                    developer course</a>. One of the mistakes that I have made before is focusing
                    on the end goal and getting the certificate rather than actually
                    learning the material. I have decided to take a different approach this time.
                    As this is the third time I am attempting at going through this 
                    curriculum, there are some concepts that I am already familiar with.
                    However, to really enforce these concepts, I will be taking their advice and really going through
                    the content in detail and breaking it into parts throughout the duration of the summer.
                    I do have the time, so I do not find it necessarily to only limit my learning to 30 minutes
                    a day, but what I will do is decide to stop when I am feeling tired or overwhelmed to avoid
                    burnout. I will also be taking breaks in between to let the information sink in. Also, 
                    consistency is key, so I will be trying to get in at least one session
                    a day.
                </p>
                <h3>After Completing the HTML Section</h3>
                <p>I have a solid understanding of HTML and its elements. I can create well-structured 
                    web pages using semantic HTML tags, and I am familiar with best practices for accessibility and SEO.
                    In all honesty, some of the lectures were hard and long to get through
                but ultimately, I believe they were worth it. One of the things I would say is to
                start practicing immediately. Even though you may want to start using React Libraries
            or AI to create a website, I think there is something fundamental about creating an inherently terrible
            website as you learn and build on the website as you continue your journey.</p>
