        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <!-- Short Introduction -->
        <section>
            <p>Hi, I’m Keith — a Computer Science and Statistics student at Rutgers University with a passion for problem-solving, creative software development, and machine learning.</p>

        <!-- What Drives Me -->
        <section>
            <p>
                What first drew me to computer science wasn’t just coding — it was the thrill of solving problems and building things that make life easier or more inspiring. I’ve always loved figuring things out, whether it’s cracking algorithms on LeetCode or crafting a meaningful UI from scratch.

        <!-- What I am currently doing -->
        <section>
            <p>
                This summer, I’m diving into machine learning through Stanford’s CS229, working on two internships (data analytics + software dev), and learning full-stack development while building personal projects. I also stay active in student life as the Marketing Chair for the AI Club and VP of the Origami Club.
            </p>

        <!-- My Career Goals -->
        <section>
            <p>
                I’m currently focused on a career in machine learning engineering or AI-driven software development, with a long-term goal of possibly transitioning into product management or technical leadership. Wherever I go, I want to be at the intersection of tech, creativity, and real-world impact.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Personality Section -->
        <section>
            <p>
                When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring new hiking trails, practicing origami, or playing video games with friends. I’m always up for a challenge, whether it’s in the code or on the trail.
